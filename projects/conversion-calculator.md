# ðŸ§® Conversion Calculator

Write a command line tool that allows the user to choose between three conversion calculators: temperature, weight, and distance. Once the user chooses a calculator prompt them for what they will be converting from (Fahrenheit/Celsius, Pounds/Kilograms, Miles/Kilometers), then prompt for the value that needs to be converted. The program should continue running until the user tells it to quit. 

## Getting Started

To start off try building one of the calculators. Then add more calculators using `if` statements. Once you have them working try adding a loop that stops when the user asks it to close.
