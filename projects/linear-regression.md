# üìè Basic Linear Regression Model with Scikit-Learn

Solution | [All Ideas](/README.md)

Linear regression models are a very simple yet powerful tool to make predictions or explain linearly correlated data. For this project, we will be using a sample dataset generated for the purpose of learning how to create a linear regression model.

## Getting Started

### Dataset

For this project you will need the dataset which can be downloaded from [here](https://www.kaggle.com/andonians/random-linear-regression). This dataset will contain two files: 
- train.csv
- test.csv

which will be used to train and test your linear regression model.

### Recommended Libraries
For this project, we recommend (and will be using in the solution) the following libraries:
- jupyterlab/ jupyter-notebook (Using a notebook is normally easier for developing machine learning models)
- pandas
- numpy
- matplotlib and/or seaborn
- scikit-learn

If you need to install any of these libraries, they can be installed either through pypi:
```
pip install [library name]
```
or anaconda
```
conda install [library name]
conda install -c conda-forge scikit-learn    // for scikit-learn
```

Before installing any of these libraries, we recommend you to use a virtual python environment for this project.


## Solution

The solution is currently not available yet but will be uploaded as soon as possible.
