# ❌⭕ Tic Tac Toe

[Solution](/solutions/tic-tac-toe.md) | [All Ideas](/README.md)

Write a command line program that allows two players to play Tic Tac Toe. At the end, the winner or a draw should be declared.

## Getting Started

You'll need to think what you want your data structure to look like for storing the values on the board and how to alternate between two different players.

To start off, work on just printing out an empty board. 
You can then come up with a way to ask each player in turn where they would like to play.
Don't forget to check if the game is over on each turn.
