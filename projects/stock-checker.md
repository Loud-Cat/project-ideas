# ðŸ“ˆ Stock Checker

[Solution](/solutions/stock-checker.md) | [All Ideas](/README.md)

Write a command line tool that allows the user to enter a stock symbol and then displays the latest price for that stock.

## Getting Started

You will need to find and register with a service that provides an API for accessing stock information. We would recommend [IEX Cloud](https://iexcloud.io/) as it is free to sign up and has thorough documentation.

Regardless of which service you choose to use, you will need to read through the documentation to find the endpoint that will provide you with the required information and understand how to use it.

The [requests](https://pypi.org/project/requests/) package available from pypi may be beneficial for this project.

## Note

While it would be possible to scrape this information from websites, we would ask that you do not do this and instead use a documented API. Generally scraping is prohibited in many websites terms of service and it is much easier to use an API to get exactly the data that you want.
