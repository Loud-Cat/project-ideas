## Contributing Project Ideas & Solutions

You can contribute your ideas & solutions by forking this repository and then creating a pull request with your additions and updates. Make sure to put any detailed project instructions in the `projects` folder and put any solutions in the `solutions` folder. Ideally solutions will contain a fully functioning solution in at least one language along with a detailed markdown document walking through the steps followed to arrive at the solution. The instructions, solutions, and walk-through should all have the same name (`tic-tac-toe.md`, `tic-tac-toe.py`, `tic-tac-toe.js`, etc.) with the instructions and walk-through both being `md` files with the same name but in their respective folders(`tic-tac-toe.md`).

Ideas can be added to this file without instructions or a solution. When instructions are provided, the idea name should be linked from here to the instructions. When a walk-through is provided it should be linked to from here in braces after the name of the idea, the link should have the text "Solution".
